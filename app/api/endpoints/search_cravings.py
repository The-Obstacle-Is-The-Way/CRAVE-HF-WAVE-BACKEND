# app/api/endpoints/search_cravings.py
"""
This module implements the search endpoint for the CRAVE Trinity Backend.

It exposes a GET route at /api/cravings/search which:
  • Accepts query parameters: user_id and query text.
  • Uses the CravingRepository to search for matching cravings.
  • Converts the ORM objects into Pydantic models for a consistent response.
